# Codingo
 
Codingo is a SwiftUI Proof of Concept (POC) project that demonstrates the integration and usage of String Catalogs for localization, alongside SwiftGen, to showcase how projects can transition from using SwiftGen for localizations to String Catalogs.

This project includes examples of how to handle:

Basic Localized Strings
Pluralization
Date Localization
